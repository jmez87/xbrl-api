## Overview

The XBRL API is connected to the XBRL US Public Filings Database - updated approximately every 15 minutes from the SEC's EDGAR system. This API provides structured access to financial data from public company filings, making it an essential tool for:

- **Accountants & CPAs**: Streamline client research, benchmarking, and compliance analysis
- **Finance Professionals**: Access real-time financial data for analysis, modeling, and reporting
- **Investment Analysts**: Automate data collection for investment research and due diligence
- **Academic Researchers**: Access standardized financial data for empirical studies

Any database with XBRL data can use the XBRL API to retrieve data from it.
